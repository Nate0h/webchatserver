In this assignment you will write a tiny chat/messaging server that works over the HTTP protocol in Java.

The Chat Server Protocol
You will build a basic chat server in Java that allows users to login with a username and password, and post messages to a chat log. 
The server uses HTTP as the base protocol. Recall from the beginning of class that HTTP uses strings as the base data-type and 
message have a structure with a header consisting of variable-value pairs, followed by a body with data.
