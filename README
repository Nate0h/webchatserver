Tiny chat/messaging server that works over the HTTP protocol in Java.

The Chat Server Protocol
Built a basic chat server in Java that allows users to login with a username and password, and post messages to a chat log. 
The server uses HTTP as the base protocol. 


See the help-clients.txt for how to run the clients and help-server.txt for how to run the server.
